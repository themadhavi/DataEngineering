Retail Sales Analysis - Capstone Project

Project Overview
This project is part of a Data Engineering course using Python. The aim of the project is to analyze a retail sales dataset to derive insights into total sales, best-selling products, and sales trends over time. Additionally, data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations were performed using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains retail sales data, including:

Date: Date when the sale occurred
Product Category: Category of the sold product
Price per Unit: Sale price per product unit
Units Sold: Number of units sold per product
The dataset is cleaned to remove missing values and grouped by Product Category and Date to perform aggregations on total sales and sales trends.

Features Implemented
Data Cleaning:

Removed rows with missing values.
Converted date columns to datetime format for time-based analysis.
Sales Aggregation:

Grouped sales data by Product Category to compute total sales per product.
Calculated the average daily sales.
Sales Trend Analysis:

Plotted the total sales over time using Matplotlib.
Best-Selling Product:

Identified the product category with the highest sales.
Visualizations
Two key visualizations were created:

Sales Trend Over Time: Displays the total sales amount by date.
Sales Per Product Category: A bar chart that shows total sales per product category.
Usage
This project provides a class called RetailSalesAnalyzer with several methods:

data_clean(): Cleans the dataset by removing null values.
total_sales_per_product(): Returns the total sales per product category.
best_selling_product(): Returns the product category with the highest sales.
average_daily_sales(): Returns the average daily sales.
plot_sales_trend(): Plots the sales trend over time.
plot_sales_per_product(): Plots the total sales per product category as a bar chart.
Installation
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
Clone the repository or download the project files:

bash
Copy code
git clone <your-repo-url>
Ensure the dataset (retail_sales_dataset.csv) is in the root directory.

How to Run the Code
Import the RetailSalesAnalyzer class in your Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or local IDE).

Create an instance of the class:

python
Copy code
from retail_sales_analyzer import RetailSalesAnalyzer

analyzer = RetailSalesAnalyzer()
Call the desired methods, for example:

python
Copy code
# Clean the data
analyzer.data_clean()

# View total sales per product
print(analyzer.total_sales_per_product())

# Plot sales trend
analyzer.plot_sales_trend()

# Plot sales per product
analyzer.plot_sales_per_product()

# Get the best-selling product
print("Best Selling Product:", analyzer.best_selling_product())
Run the script in Google Colab or a local Python environment.

Future Improvements
Expand Analysis: Include additional features like monthly or seasonal sales analysis.
Advanced Visualizations: Create more detailed and interactive visualizations using Seaborn or Plotly.
Deployment: Package the project for deployment on the cloud, enabling automated reporting or dashboards.
Machine Learning: Add machine learning techniques to predict future sales based on historical data.
